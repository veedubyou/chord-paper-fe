                It's common to label sections to navigate easily within the
                song. For example, some common labels are "Verse", "Chorus",
                "Bridge", or more simplified markers like "A", "B", etc.
            </Typography>
            <LineBreak />
            <Typography>
                Add a label to a line by hovering over the line, and then
                clicking the <ChatBubbleIcon /> icon to insert a label for that
                line. Let's add{" "}
                <LabelTypography display="inline">Verse</LabelTypography> to the
                first line.
            </Typography>
            <LineBreak />
            <Typography>Try it!</Typography>
